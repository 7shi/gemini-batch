# Package Initialization Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Dynamic Version Management
**Problem**: Hardcoding version strings in source code requires manual synchronization between pyproject.toml and __init__.py, creating maintenance burden and potential inconsistencies during releases.

**Solution**: Used `importlib.metadata.version()` to dynamically read version from installed package metadata, ensuring single source of truth in pyproject.toml and eliminating version synchronization issues.

### Minimal Public API Exposure
**Problem**: Exposing internal implementation details through package imports would create implicit API contracts that constrain future refactoring and maintenance flexibility.

**Solution**: Limited __all__ exports to only the core functional modules (submit, poll), keeping the package interface focused and maintainable while hiding implementation details.

### Module Import Organization
**Problem**: Direct access to submodules without proper package structure would make it difficult to reorganize code or add new features without breaking existing integrations.

**Solution**: Established clear module import hierarchy with explicit __all__ declarations, providing stable entry points for any programmatic usage while maintaining internal flexibility.
