# Batch Job Submission Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Efficient Multi-file Batch Processing
**Problem**: Original reference implementation only supported single file processing, requiring manual execution 23 times for multiple JSONL files in a batch directory, creating inefficient and error-prone workflows.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-file argument support enabling bulk submission with `gembatch submit *.jsonl`, allowing efficient processing of entire file sets in a single command execution.

### JSONL-based Job Management for Scalability
**Problem**: Reference implementation's JSON format job management could only record single jobs, making it inadequate for multi-job management, with difficult job information appending and searching capabilities.

**Solution**: Adopted JSONL format management with job-info.jsonl, recording one job per line to efficiently implement duplicate checking against existing jobs and appending new job records.

### Duplicate Submission Prevention for Safety
**Problem**: Accidentally submitting the same file multiple times would cause unnecessary API usage and costs, potentially creating confusion in subsequent processing operations.

**Solution**: Implemented duplicate checking functionality by reading existing job-info.jsonl and using input_file as key for verification, automatically skipping already submitted files to ensure safe operations.

### Proper Resource Cleanup on Errors
**Problem**: When batch job creation fails, remaining uploaded files would unnecessarily consume Gemini storage and potentially affect subsequent processing operations.

**Solution**: Implemented error handling similar to reference implementation that automatically deletes uploaded files when job creation fails, ensuring proper resource management.

### Process Visibility Through Progress Display
**Problem**: During bulk processing of 23 files, progress was unclear, making it difficult to identify error locations and determine processing completion status.

**Solution**: Implemented progress display in `[processed/total]` format with individual file processing results (success/skip/error) to ensure processing transparency.

### Secure Execution Through Input Validation
**Problem**: When invalid file paths or non-existent files are specified, unexpected errors or incomplete processing could occur.

**Solution**: Implemented existence verification for each input file and pre-validation of GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable, with early termination and appropriate error messages for problematic conditions.

### Enhanced Operations Through Batch Information Recording
**Problem**: Without comprehensive job information in job management history, estimating processing time and investigating issues becomes difficult.

**Solution**: Record complete batch job information using `batch_to_dict()` in job_record's `batch` object after successful `client.batches.create`, storing structured data including creation time, model, state, and other metadata for comprehensive operational analysis.

### Configurable Model Selection for Flexibility
**Problem**: Different use cases require different Gemini models (e.g., thinking models for complex reasoning, flash models for speed), but hardcoding a single model would limit tool adaptability.

**Solution**: Added `-m`/`--model` parameter with sensible default (gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17) to allow model selection while providing out-of-the-box functionality for most users.

### Comprehensive Job Record Enhancement for Resource Management
**Problem**: Job records needed to include complete information for downstream operations: query count for monitoring displays and source file identifiers for reliable cleanup operations during polling.

**Solution**: Enhanced job record structure to include `count` field (calculated using `count_lines()` from batch_info module) showing the number of queries in each input file, and `uploaded_file_name` field preserving the source file identifier returned by the upload API. This comprehensive recording enables effective monitoring through query count visibility and ensures reliable resource cleanup regardless of API limitations in batch objects.

### Atomic Job Manager Integration for Race Condition Prevention
**Problem**: Original implementation used direct file append operations that created race conditions when poll processes were running simultaneously, potentially causing data corruption or loss of newly submitted jobs from the job tracking file.

**Solution**: Integrated `AtomicJobManager` from batch_info module to provide thread-safe file operations. The entire submission process now runs under a single atomic context - reading existing jobs, duplicate checking, and saving new jobs all occur within one `AtomicJobManager` session. This approach prevents race conditions with polling operations while ensuring all changes are committed atomically when the submission process completes.

### Code Simplification and Import Optimization
**Problem**: Legacy code contained unused imports (`os`, `json`, `datetime`) and redundant functions (`load_existing_jobs`, `save_job_record`) that added complexity without providing functional value after the atomic manager integration.

**Solution**: Removed all unused imports and obsolete functions, replacing them with direct `AtomicJobManager` usage. Simplified the codebase by eliminating redundant file operations and focusing on the essential submission logic. The `submit_batch_job` function now receives the manager instance directly, eliminating per-file lock acquisition and improving efficiency while maintaining clean, focused code.
