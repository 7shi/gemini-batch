# Batch Job Submission Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Efficient Multi-file Batch Processing
**Problem**: Original reference implementation only supported single file processing, requiring manual execution 23 times for multiple JSONL files in a batch directory, creating inefficient and error-prone workflows.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-file argument support enabling bulk submission with `gembatch submit *.jsonl`, allowing efficient processing of entire file sets in a single command execution.

### JSONL-based Job Management for Scalability
**Problem**: Reference implementation's JSON format job management could only record single jobs, making it inadequate for multi-job management, with difficult job information appending and searching capabilities.

**Solution**: Adopted JSONL format management with job-info.jsonl, recording one job per line to efficiently implement duplicate checking against existing jobs and appending new job records.

### Duplicate Submission Prevention for Safety
**Problem**: Accidentally submitting the same file multiple times would cause unnecessary API usage and costs, potentially creating confusion in subsequent processing operations.

**Solution**: Implemented duplicate checking functionality by reading existing job-info.jsonl and using input_file as key for verification, automatically skipping already submitted files to ensure safe operations.

### Proper Resource Cleanup on Errors
**Problem**: When batch job creation fails, remaining uploaded files would unnecessarily consume Gemini storage and potentially affect subsequent processing operations.

**Solution**: Implemented error handling similar to reference implementation that automatically deletes uploaded files when job creation fails, ensuring proper resource management.

### Process Visibility Through Progress Display
**Problem**: During bulk processing of 23 files, progress was unclear, making it difficult to identify error locations and determine processing completion status.

**Solution**: Implemented progress display in `[processed/total]` format with individual file processing results (success/skip/error) to ensure processing transparency.

### Secure Execution Through Input Validation
**Problem**: When invalid file paths or non-existent files are specified, unexpected errors or incomplete processing could occur.

**Solution**: Implemented existence verification for each input file and pre-validation of GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable, with early termination and appropriate error messages for problematic conditions.

### Enhanced Operations Through Batch Information Recording
**Problem**: Without comprehensive job information in job management history, estimating processing time and investigating issues becomes difficult.

**Solution**: Record complete batch job information using `batch_to_dict()` in job_record's `batch` object after successful `client.batches.create`, storing structured data including creation time, model, state, and other metadata for comprehensive operational analysis.

### Configurable Model Selection for Flexibility
**Problem**: Different use cases require different Gemini models (e.g., thinking models for complex reasoning, flash models for speed), but hardcoding a single model would limit tool adaptability.

**Solution**: Added `-m`/`--model` parameter with sensible default (gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17) to allow model selection while providing out-of-the-box functionality for most users.
