# Cleanup Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Resource Management for Development Cycles
**Problem**: During development and testing, Gemini batch files and jobs accumulate rapidly in the cloud, making it difficult to identify current work and potentially exceeding storage quotas or API limits.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive cleanup utility that lists and removes all batch resources in a single operation, enabling clean development environments between test cycles.

### Safe Deletion with Confirmation
**Problem**: Accidental deletion of all batch resources could result in loss of important ongoing work or completed results that haven't been downloaded yet.

**Solution**: Added mandatory confirmation prompt that requires explicit user approval before deletion, with optional `--yes` flag for automation scenarios where confirmation is impractical.

### Unified Resource Discovery
**Problem**: Gemini batch resources are split between files (uploaded inputs) and batch jobs (processing instances), requiring separate API calls and management approaches that users might forget.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive resource enumeration that discovers both file and batch job resources in a single operation, ensuring no orphaned resources are left behind.

### Error Resilience During Cleanup
**Problem**: Partial deletion failures could leave the system in an inconsistent state, with some resources deleted and others remaining, making it unclear what cleanup work remains.

**Solution**: Adopted continue-on-error approach that attempts deletion of each resource independently, reporting failures without stopping the overall cleanup process.
